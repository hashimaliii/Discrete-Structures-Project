1. Statement is Logically Equivalent Checker
2. Argument Checker
3. Bipartite Checker
   
Question No 1

PART 1:	
Write down a program to check whether a statement is logically equivalent or not using truth table. 
Using C++ and built-in libraries but you must have complete knowledge of it. 

PART 2:
Write down a program to check whether an argument is valid or not using truth table. If it is valid then print the truth table, if not then highlight the specific row(s) in the truth table due to which the argument is invalid.
Using C++ and built-in libraries but you must have complete knowledge of it.

Question No 2	
Write down a program to check the given graph whether it is Bipartite or not.
If not, then display the vertices which are causing conflict.
Using C++ and built-in libraries but you must have complete knowledge of it.
